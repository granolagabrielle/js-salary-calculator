## Description

This is my Javascript salary calculator. The calculator contains an input form that collects various data points, including salary, and adds the info to a display table, while totaling the monthly salary costs for the business.

Additional README details can be found [here](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/readme-template/blob/master/README.md).
